# Approval-Based Committee Voting in the Presence of Constraints
A new framework that extends ABC voting with a database context.
In this work we study approval-based committee voting in the presence of external constraints expressed as database 
dependencies over a relational database with information about the candidates.
In order to solve this new problem we build an appropriate MIP program.

### Datasets
In our existing experiments we use datasets of three different domains, and in order to use them you should download the 
datasets, and refer to the next chapter to see how to add it to the project and create a database properly.
The used datasets are:
* The Glasgow City Council Election Dataset. This dataset is taken from Preflib at 
https://preflib.simonrey.fr/dataset/00008 and donated by Jeffery Oâ€™Neill. Open STV. www.OpenSTV.org, 2013.
* The Trip Advisor Dataset. This dataset is taken from Preflib at https://preflib.simonrey.fr/dataset/00040 and was
scraped and denoted by Hongning Wang, first introduced in (Wang, Lu, and Zhai 2010).
* The Movies Dataset. This dataset is taken from Kaggle 
at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/data, the dataset is an ensemble of data 
collected from TMDB and GroupLens.

### How to add new database?
All datasets should locate under:
```database/databases/datasets_data/<new_dataset_folder>```
All ```.db``` sqlite databases should locate under:
```database/databases/sqlite_databases/<database_name>```

In the module ```create_database``` we show several examples of building a new ```.db``` sqlite file given an appropriate csv files 
that describes the relations.
Furthermore, we show several examples of handling soi, dat, and csv datasets cleaning and preparation, and exports a 
general functionality to handle similar cases.

### How to run an experiment?
This project requires python3, sqlite3, ortools (and any additional solver you want to define for the ortools wrapper, 
we found Gurobi to work well on this problem).
The experiments are located under:
```ilp/experiments/<dataset_name>/<experiment_number>/<experiment_file>```
To run an experiment can simply run the python file.
Note that ```config.py``` holds important settings for your experiment, such as DEBUG mode.
Important Note: The value of ```config.MOVIES_DATABASE_DB_NAME``` should be the path for your database, the current value
assume that you place a copy of your .db file in your experiment folder, this is because in order to run experiments in 
parallel you should access to different db files. Therefor, you should either copy your db file to your experiment folder, 
or change the value of this constant to be the path to your shared db.
The result of this experiments can be found in ```ilp/experiments/<dataset_name>/results```.

### How to define a new experiment?
Experiment is defined by a database, ABC settings and external constraints.
You can define constraints of the form of TGD and DC, and there a lot of examples in this repo for three different databases.
It is recommended to check the documentation of ```config.py``` and ```combined_constraints_experiments.py``` for further information.

### How to add a new score function?
Under ```ilp/ilp_reduction/score_functions``` you can define a new function with the appropriate interface of score function, that 
returns the voter committee score contribution, and use it in your experiment.
